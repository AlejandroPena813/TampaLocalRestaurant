  <p>
    Restaurant Bella Colombia in Tampa is now serving up Latin American soul food with a side of love for their Colombian roots!<br/><br/>
    Authentic Colombian Food is the name of the game & no Colombian Restaurant does it better. Our Colombian owners themselves oversee operations, service and of course the quality of taste so that everything is authentic just the way mom or “Abuelita” used to make it.<br/><br/>

This dish will most definitely satisfy a big appetite and surprise your taste buds.<br/><br/>
